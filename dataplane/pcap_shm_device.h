/**
 * @brief A class for writing packets to a shared memory region in pcap format, using a ring-buffer
 * approach.
 *
 * The objective is to enable continuous packet capture while utilizing a limited amount of memory.
 * The approach adopted here is inspired by Wireshark's "multiple files, ring buffer" feature:
 *
 * Multiple files, ring buffer:
 * "Much like 'Multiple files continuous', reaching one of the multiple files switch conditions
 * (one of the 'Next file every â€¦' values) will switch to the next file. This will be a newly
 * created file if the value of 'Ring buffer with n files' is not reached; otherwise, it will
 * replace the oldest of the formerly used files (thus forming a 'ring').
 *
 * This mode will limit the maximum disk usage, even for an unlimited amount of capture input data,
 * only keeping the latest captured data."
 * (Source: https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsug_html_chunked/ChCapCaptureFiles.html)
 *
 * **Algorithm Behind Ring-Buffer Writing:**
 * The shared memory region is divided into multiple segments (each representing a 'virtual pcap
 * file'). Packets are written sequentially into the current segment. If there isn't enough space
 * for a new packet, the writer 'rotates' to the next segment.
 * - Suppose you have N segments.
 * - You write packets into segment 1 until it's almost full.
 * - If you can't fit a new packet, you move to segment 2, and continue writing there.
 * - Once you reach segment N and still have more packets, you wrap around to segment 1 again,
 *   overwriting old data.
 *
 * After all packets are written, `DumpPcapFilesToDisk()` can be used to extract each segment
 * into a standalone pcap file.
